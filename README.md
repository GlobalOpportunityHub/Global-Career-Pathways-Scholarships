For scholarships, there are two kinds:

1. Country government based. Examples: US Fulbright, UK Chevening and Commonwealth, Australian Awards, Hungary Stipendium, Turkey Burslari, China CSC, Japana MEXT, Germany DAAD, Korea KGSP, Malaysia, Hongkong, Holland, France, Italy, etc. 

For each of them you have to check deadline and application materials such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, Any tests like (GRE or IELTS or TOEFL) , etc by checking online their websites. 

The good thing is that once you prepare your application material, the same could be used to almost all scholarships by making small changes smartly.

2. The other one is the most available one but needs more efforts to find. Almost in every country but specifically in US, Canada, Australia, etc.

 If you get admission in the university in graduate program directly, it comes with a fully funded scholarship. 

Now, to get admission you have to compete with the brilliant candidates all over the world. 

The admission committee reviews the applications and makes the decision. 


To get these scholarships, you have to go to google website and search QS Ranking top 700 ranked universities.

 You could also search universities by your subject say “Banking,etc”


Make a word or excel table, select the ones you would like and enter in the table. 

Now everyday select 2-3 universities to visit their websites and your relevant department faculty, and enter the names in your excel table alongwith their emails.

 Now everyday write around 4-5 emails to Professors to convince them through your skills, experience and competence, that you are a good fit for the Professor’s research and why he/she should accept you in the group.

 Why this email is important is because once the Professor agrees then there are high chances of admission committee accepting your application and you getting admission and scholarship.

 As said, this is common mode of getting admission in US, Canada (a member on this group got scholarship using this), most students here are on this university scholarship, but it takes some effort and patience to get it.
